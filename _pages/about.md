I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the College of Engineering at Northeastern University, advised by [Prof. Yun Raymond Fu](https://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) in the [SMILE Lab](https://fulab.sites.northeastern.edu/). Before joining Northeastern, I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xidian University, China, where I was advised by [Prof. Xuefeng Liang](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/xliang/en/index.html). During my master’s studies, I also spent six months at Kyoto University, working with [Prof. Takatsune Kumada](https://kdb.iimc.kyoto-u.ac.jp/profile/en.a61c204316cdb5fc.html#display-items_basic-information).

My research interests include **Multimodal LLMs, Hallucination Detection & Mitigation, and Video Understanding**.

In Summer 2025, I interned at **Adobe Research**.

You can find my full CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](../files/CVFall2025.pdf).
